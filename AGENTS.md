# GitNexus — Code Intelligence

This project is indexed by GitNexus as **YourExam_Backend** (777 symbols, 1400 relationships, 21 execution flows). Use the GitNexus MCP tools to understand code, assess impact, and navigate safely.

> If any GitNexus tool warns the index is stale, run `npx gitnexus analyze` in terminal first.

## Always Do

- **MUST run impact analysis before editing any symbol.** Before modifying a function, class, or method, run `gitnexus_impact({target: "symbolName", direction: "upstream"})` and report the blast radius (direct callers, affected processes, risk level) to the user.
- **MUST run `gitnexus_detect_changes()` before committing** to verify your changes only affect expected symbols and execution flows.
- **MUST warn the user** if impact analysis returns HIGH or CRITICAL risk before proceeding with edits.
- When exploring unfamiliar code, use `gitnexus_query({query: "concept"})` to find execution flows instead of grepping. It returns process-grouped results ranked by relevance.
- When you need full context on a specific symbol — callers, callees, which execution flows it participates in — use `gitnexus_context({name: "symbolName"})`.

## Never Do

- NEVER edit a function, class, or method without first running `gitnexus_impact` on it.
- NEVER ignore HIGH or CRITICAL risk warnings from impact analysis.
- NEVER rename symbols with find-and-replace — use `gitnexus_rename` which understands the call graph.
- NEVER commit changes without running `gitnexus_detect_changes()` to check affected scope.

# C# .NET Clean Architecture Rules & Guidelines

## 1. Project Structure & Dependency Flow
Enforce Clean Architecture layer separation. Dependencies MUST pointing INWARD only:
`Web.API` -> `Infrastructure` -> `Application` -> `Domain`

- **Domain Layer (`Core/Domain`)**: 
  - Contains Entities, Value Objects, Domain Events, Enums, and Repository Interfaces.
  - Zero external dependencies! (NO EF Core, NO ASP.NET, NO third-party packages except C# primitives/guards).
- **Application Layer (`Core/Application`)**:
  - Contains Use Cases (CQRS Commands/Queries), DTOs, Mapping, and Service Interfaces.
  - Depends ONLY on the `Domain` layer.
- **Infrastructure Layer (`Infrastructure`)**:
  - Contains EF Core DbContext, External Services integration (Email, Supabase, Payment), Repositories implementations.
- **Web.API Layer (`Presentation/Web.API`)**:
  - Contains Controllers / Minimal APIs, Middlewares, Program.cs DI configurations.

---

## 2. C# Language & Modern Code Quality
- **Language Level**: Use modern C# features (C# 12+ / .NET 8+).
- **Immutability**: Prefer `record` for DTOs, Commands, Queries, and Value Objects.
- **Nullable Context**: `<Nullable>enable</Nullable>` is mandatory. Avoid using `!` (null-forgiving) unless strictly necessary.
- **Async/Await**: 
  - All I/O operations MUST be async (`async Task<T>`).
  - Always pass `CancellationToken` down to the DB/I/O level.
- **Primary Constructors**: Use primary constructors for Dependency Injection in classes and record definitions.

---

## 3. Application Layer & CQRS Pattern
- Implement CQRS using **MediatR** (or explicit Command/Query handlers).
- Organize code by **Feature/Vertical Slices** within Application:
  `Features/[FeatureName]/Commands/Create[Entity]/`
  - `Create[Entity]Command.cs` (MediatR `IRequest<Result<T>>`)
  - `Create[Entity]CommandHandler.cs`
  - `Create[Entity]CommandValidator.cs` (FluentValidation)
- **DTO Isolation**: NEVER return Domain Entities directly from API or Application Layer. ALWAYS map to DTOs.
- **Validation**: Use **FluentValidation** for automatic command/query validation via MediatR pipeline behaviors.

---

## 4. Entity Framework Core & Data Access
- **Encapsulation**: Use private setters or `init` properties for Entities. Enforce business logic through Entity methods.
- **Queries Optimization**:
  - Use `.AsNoTracking()` for ALL read-only queries.
  - Avoid N+1 queries using explicit `.Include()` / `.ThenInclude()` or Projection (`.Select()`).
- **Configuration**: Use `IEntityTypeConfiguration<T>` in Infrastructure layer instead of attributes on Domain Entities.

---

## 5. API Design & Global Error Handling
- **Controllers / Endpoints**: Keep them thin! Delegates business execution to MediatR (`IMediator.Send()`).
- **RESTful Naming**: Plural nouns for routes (e.g., `api/v1/users`). Explicit status codes (200, 201, 400, 404, 500).
- **Error Handling**: 
  - Do NOT use exceptions for control flow. Use a **Result Pattern** (`Result<T>` or `OneOf`).
  - Handle unexpected exceptions globally via `IExceptionHandler` middleware producing **RFC 7807 ProblemDetails** JSON responses.

---

## 6. Code Generation Checklist for AI
When generating new features, always generate code in this order:
1. **Domain Entity / Value Object** (if new)
2. **Repository Interface** (in Domain)
3. **Command/Query & DTOs** (in Application)
4. **Validator** (in Application)
5. **CommandHandler / QueryHandler** (in Application)
6. **EF Core Configuration & Repository Implementation** (in Infrastructure)
7. **Controller / Minimal API Endpoint** (in Web.API)

- **Before Feature Development**: You MUST read `gitnexus://repo/YourExam_Frontend/context`, `clusters`, and `processes` via GitNexus MCP to understand the current file organization, directory structure, and execution flows before writing code.

<!-- begin:Karpathy-Inspired Claude Code Guidelines -->

- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

## 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

## 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:
- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:
- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

## 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:
- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:
```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

---

**These guidelines are working if:** fewer unnecessary changes in diffs, fewer rewrites due to overcomplication, and clarifying questions come before implementation rather than after mistakes.
